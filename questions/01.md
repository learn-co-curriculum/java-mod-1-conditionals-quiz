# Multiple Choice Question

Consider the following code:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Random random = new Random();

        boolean isRainy = random.nextBoolean();

        // Tell the user the weather forecast for the day
        if (isRainy) {
            System.out.println("It's rainy outside today! Better stay inside.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("It's sunny outside today! What a beautiful day.");
        }
    }
}
```

What does the program output when `weather` is randomly assigned to `true`?

## Correct

It's rainy outside today! Better stay inside.

> Correct! Since the `random.nextBoolean()` randomly assigned the `weather`
> variable to `true`, the execution will fall into the `if` block and print the
> rainy message.

## Incorrect

Nothing

> Not quite. This program will always print something since there is a
> `System.out.println()` statement in both the `if` and the `else` blocks.

## Incorrect

It's sunny outside today! What a beautiful day.

> Not quite. Since the `random.nextBoolean()` randomly assigned the `weather`
> variable to `true`, the message in the `else` block will not be printed at all
> since the execution will skip over it.
