# Multiple Choice Question

Consider the following snippet of code:

```java
if (temperature < -100.0) {
    System.out.println("Invalid temperature.");
} else if (temperature > 135.0) {
    System.out.println("Invalid temperature.");
} else {
    // Other statements that deal with a valid temperature
}
```

The first two conditions seem to print the same message. How can you combine
these two conditions?

## Correct

`if (temperature < -100.0 || temperature > 135.0)`

> Correct! We can use the logical operator `||` and turn this into a compound
> conditional.

## Incorrect

`if (temperature < -100.0 && temperature > 135.0)`

> Note quite. This boolean expression will always evaluate to `false` since it
> is impossible to have a temperature value be both less than -100 AND greater
> than 135.

## Incorrect

It's not possible.

> Not quite. We can combine two boolean expressions if appropriate. In this
> case, we can use the `||` operator:
> `if (temperature < -100.0 || temperature > 135.0)`
