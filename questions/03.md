# Multiple Dropdowns Question

Consider the following code:

```java
import java.util.InputMismatchException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        try {
            // Prompt the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit
            System.out.println("Enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit:");
            double temperature = scanner.nextDouble();

            // If temperature is 32 degrees or below, alert the user it is freezing!
            if (temperature <= 32.0) {
                System.out.println("Brr it's freezing!");
            } else if (temperature >= 212.0) {
                // If the temperature is 212 degrees or higher, alert the user it is boiling
                System.out.println("It's boiling!");
            }

        } catch (InputMismatchException exception) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input");
        }
    }
}
```

When the user enters in 98.5 as a value, the program outputs: [a1]

When the user enters in 17 as a value, the program outputs: [a2]

When the user enters in 212.0 as a value, the program outputs: [a3]

## Correct

- Nothing
- a1

> Correct! The program will not print anything if the user input is greater
> than 32.0 degrees and less than 212.0 degrees.

## Incorrect

- Brr it's freezing!
- a1

> Not quite. The execution will skip over the `if` and `else if` statements
> since the input is greater than 32.0 and less than 212.0 degrees.

## Incorrect

- Invalid input
- a1

> Not quite. 98.5 is a valid input.

## Incorrect

- It's boiling!
- a1

> Not quite. The execution will skip over the `if` and `else if` statements
> since the input is greater than 32.0 and less than 212.0 degrees.

## Correct

- Brr it's freezing!
- a2

> Correct! The program will print the message inside the `if` block since the
> input is less than or equal to the freezing point, 32.0.

## Incorrect

- It's boiling!
- a2

> Not quite. The execution will not fall into the `else if` block since the
> first conditional specified in the `if` statement has been satisfied. The
> execution will then skip over the `else if` block.

- Nothing

> Not quite. The execution will fall into the `if` block and print the message

## Incorrect

- Invalid input
- a2

> Not quite. 17 is a valid input.

## Correct

- It's boiling!
- a3

> Correct! The program will print the message inside the `else if` block since
> the input is greater than or equal to the boiling point, 212.0.

## Incorrect

- Brr it's freezing!
- a3

> Not quite. The execution will not fall into the `if` block since the input is
> greater than 32.0. Instead, it will then check the conditional specified in
> the `else if` statement. Since 212.0 is indeed greater than or equal to the
> boiling point, it will fall into the `else if` block.
