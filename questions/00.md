# Multiple Dropdowns Question

Consider the following code:

```java
import java.util.InputMismatchException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        try {
            // Prompt the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit
            System.out.println("Enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit:");
            double temperature = scanner.nextDouble();

            // If temperature is 32 degrees or below, alert the user it is freezing!
            if (temperature <= 32.0) {
                System.out.println("Brr it's freezing!");
            }

        } catch (InputMismatchException exception) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input");
        }
    }
}
```

When the user enters in 98.5 as a value, the program outputs: [a1]

When the user enters in 17 as a value, the program outputs: [a2]

## Correct

- Nothing
- a1

> Correct! The program will not print anything if the user input is greater
> than 32.0 degrees.

## Incorrect

- Brr it's freezing!
- a1

> Not quite. The execution will skip over the `if` statement since the input is
> greater than 32.0.

## Incorrect

- Invalid input
- a1

> Not quite. 98.5 is a valid input.

## Correct

- Brr it's freezing!
- a2

> Correct! The program will print the message inside the `if` block since the
> input is less than or equal to the freezing point, 32.0.

## Incorrect

- Nothing
- a2

> Not quite. The execution will fall into the `if` block and print the message
> since the input is less than or equal to 32.0.
