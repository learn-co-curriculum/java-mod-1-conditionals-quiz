# Short Answer Question

What is the output of the following program if the user enters in "snowy"?

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the weather forecast for today:");
        String weather = scanner.nextLine();

        switch (weather) {
            case "sunny":
                System.out.println("It's sunny outside today");
                break;
            case "rainy":
                System.out.println("It's rainy outside today");
                break;
            case "cloudy":
                System.out.println("It's cloudy outside today");
                break;
            case "snowy":
                System.out.println("It's snowy outside today");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("We aren't sure about the weather today");
        }
    }
}
```
